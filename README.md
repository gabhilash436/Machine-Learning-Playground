# Machine-Learning-
Most of machine learning algorithms will be available here. (Both in Python and R)

I will be adding machine learning and deep learning algorithms one by one. Follow me and keep yourself updated !!
Most of these algorithms were part of machine learning a-z course on udemy. I am using github as a playing field. 

currently available implementations 
1. Eclat
2. Apriori
3. simple linear regression
4. polynomial regression 
5. Decision tree regression
6. Random forest regression 
7. Logistic regression
8. KNN classification 
9. SVM classiffier
10. Kernel SVM classifier 
11. Naive bayes classifier 
12. Decision Tree classification 
13. Random Forest Classification
14. Natural language processing - Basic implementation of Bag of Words
15. Principle component analysis
16. artificial neural network - example_01
17. .................
